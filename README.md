# 📦 GitHub Repo Dependency Checker

A web tool that checks for outdated dependencies in any public GitHub repository. Just paste a GitHub repo URL, and instantly see which `npm` packages are up-to-date, outdated, or dangerously behind.

## 🧠 Problem Solved

Developers often clone open-source repositories without realizing that some dependencies are outdated or insecure. This tool solves that by:

- Listing all `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
- Showing the installed vs latest versions
- Highlighting outdated or major-breaking packages
- Offering a quick health check before running or contributing to a repo

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Paste any public GitHub repo URL  
- ✅ Fetches and parses `package.json`  
- ✅ Checks each dependency against the npm registry  
- ✅ Highlights outdated packages with clear visual feedback  
- ✅ Clean and simple UI — no login required  
- ✅ Built using modern JavaScript

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a GitHub repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/user/project-name`)
2. The app uses GitHub's REST API to fetch the `package.json` file
3. The dependencies and devDependencies are extracted
4. Each package is checked against the npm registry for the latest version
5. Results are displayed in a table, with version status indicators
